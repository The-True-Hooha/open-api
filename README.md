# OpenAI API Readme

This repository provides an integration of the OpenAI API into your application. With the OpenAI API, you can access state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning models, including GPT-3 and DALL-E.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to sign up for an OpenAI API key. You can do this by creating an account on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/) and selecting the API plan that best fits your needs.

Once you have an API key, you can authenticate your requests by including your key in the `Authorization` header of your requests.
